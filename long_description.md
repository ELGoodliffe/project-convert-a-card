Currently, the only way to discover thousands of the printed books held in our
collections is to manually flick through huge card catalogues held at the British Library.

It is our hope, with your help, to transform these printed cards into electronic
records for inclusion in our online catalogue, [Explore](http://explore.bl.uk/).

### The task

On the next page you will be presented with a digitised image of the printed card
catalogue record and asked to:

1. Use the details on the card to search an external database and locate the
matching electronic catalogue record.
2. Once located, transcribe the unique British Library
[shelfmark](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/shelf-mark)
found on the card.

The resulting electronic record can then be imported into British Library’s online
catalogue, making this huge collection of research material far easier to discover
and access.
